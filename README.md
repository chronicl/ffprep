# Abyssos Savage Tier

## Random thoughts after prog
disclaimer: all of these thoughts are not always the perfect thing to do or assume, but they should be taken into consideration
- stacks in normal mode usually become light party stacks in savage (p5s and one of the asphodelos raids)
- simple timeline/order of mechanics can help a lot especially if the fight is long
- put markers above the heads of the healers for easier group identification
- look for patterns in each mechanic, especially the first 2 fights of a tier won't have more than 2 patterns for all mechanics
- 2 dps rezzers for the first two fights (rdm and smn), maybe even double/triple rdm which you swap out when close to kill can be good
- when seeing a mechanic the first time consider having a rezzer run into the wall, rez them, have a tank survive, after the mechanic take the rez and get everyone else up quickly to see more of the fight without having completed the previous mechanic
- when seeing a mechanic for the first time all rezzers should try to stay alive even if it may cost the life of others (i.e. don't take a stack if you don't know how many people are needed for it)
- when seeing a stack mechanic for the first time, don't stack but spread so you can later identify how many people are needed for the stack based on the damage done

## Callouts

#### positioning

- NESW only used for absolute positions
- top, right, bottom, left for relative positions, while clarifying what direction is top
- prefer "right and left looking at X" over "clockwise and counterclockwise of X" except if a universal point X can't easily be defined

#### common callouts

- "in" - close to the boss/under the boss
- "out" - away from the boss
- "pairs (intercardinal/cardinal)"

#### special callouts

- "line" - take default line positions

## Mitigation

- duplicate mitigations: simply alternate (define who goes first)
- rezzing: dps (red mage) first -> healer -> healer (needs callouts)
